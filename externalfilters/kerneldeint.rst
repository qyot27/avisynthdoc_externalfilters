Introduction
------------

This filter deinterlaces using a kernel approach. It gives greatly improved
vertical resolution in deinterlaced areas compared to simple field
discarding.

If you set the threshold to 0, you can get totally artifact free results (due
to lack of thresholding) but with much less loss of vertical resolution than
simple field discarding. For optimal results, however, set a motion threshold
that allows static areas of the picture to be passed through. In this mode,
the kernel-based deinterlacing of the moving areas preserves their vertical
resolution compared to simple interpolation.

The filter accepts RGB, YUY2, or YV12 input.

To use this filter as a post-processor for Telecide(), use the following
script:
::

    Telecide(..., post=1, hints=true)
    KernelDeint(...)

Function Syntax
---------------

KernelDeint() takes the following named parameters:

| **order** (0-1, default none!)
| This parameter defines the field order of
  the clip. It is very important to set this correctly. Use order=0 for bottom
  field first (bff). Use order=1 for top field first (tff). You must specify
  order; DGBob throws an exception if you omit this parameter.

It is essential to set the field order properly for correct rendering.
Because setting it correctly is so important, you are strongly encouraged not
to make assumptions about the field order of a clip, but rather to verify the
field order using the following procedure.

To determine the field order, make an Avisynth script that serves the raw
clip without any processing. If it were an AVI, then just AviSource() would
be used. For our examples, we'll use AviSource(). Add a script line to
separate the fields using top field first, as follows:
::

    AviSource("your_clip.avi")
    AssumeTFF().SeparateFields()

Now serve the script into VirtualDub and find an area with motion. Single
step forward through the motion. Note whether the motion progresses always
forward as it should, or whether it jumps back and forth as it proceeds. For
example, if the field order is wrong, an object moving steadily from left to
right would move right, then jump back left a little, then move right again,
etc. If the field order is correct, it moves steadily to the right.

If the motion is correct with AssumeTFF().SeparateFields(), then your field
order is top field first and you must set order=1. If the motion is
incorrect, then your field order is bottom field first and you must set
order=0. If you are want to double check things, you can use
AssumeBFF.SeparateFields() to check correct operation for bottom field first.

| **threshold** (0-255, default 10)
| This parameter defines the "motion"
  thresold. Moving areas are kernel-deinterlaced while non-moving areas are
  passed through. Use the *map* parameter to tweak the *threshold* parameter so
  that just the combed areas of the frame are deinterlaced.

| **sharp** (true/false, default false)
| This parameter, when set to true,
  selects a kernel that provides better vertical resolution and performs some
  sharpening of the video. For less sharpening but also less vertical
  resolution, set this parameter to false.

| **twoway** (true/false, default false)
| This parameter, when set to true,
  selects a kernel that includes both the previous and the following fields for
  deinterlacing. When set to false, the kernel includes only the previous
  field. The latter one-way kernel is faster, crisper, and gives less blending
  (this last advantage makes the filter perform better on anime). The *twoway*
  parameter is included in case users want to achieve the behavior of previous
  versions.

| **map** (true/false, default false)
| This parameter, when set to true, shows
  the areas that are "moving" as determined by the *threshold* parameter and
  which will be kernel-deinterlaced. Use this parameter to assist in tweaking
  the *threshold* parameter.

| **debug** (true/false, default false)
| This parameter, when set to true,
  enables debug ouput via the DebugView utility. Currently, it shows the
  version number of the filter and, if hints are present from Telecide(),
  whether frame are hinted as progressive or interlaced. If hints are not
  present, the debug output shows all frames as interlaced.
